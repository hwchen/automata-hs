## Conway's Game of Life in Haskell

Implementation of Conways' GOL in Haskell with output to ncurses.
Naive implementation, seems a bit verbose.

After running file, iterate by pressing the right arrow key.
I was unable to figure out how to use napms in ncurses library from Haskell.

For future: refactor so board size doesn't have to be passed everywhere.
